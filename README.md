# monet_photo_generator
Generating monet style photos using unpaired data, CycleGAN and DCGAN (Kaggle Competition - I’m Something of a Painter Myself).

This project is a generation project which aims to solve the kaggle competition "I’m Something of a Painter Myself" with 2 different GANs architectures: CycleGAN, DCGAN.

We use the following technologies for this project:
1. TensorFlow/Keras
2. NumPy
3. Matplotlib


## Colab notebook structure:

The notebook is divided to 5 parts. Each part for each task/approach.
1. Utils
2. Data Pre-proccessing
3. CycleGAN
4. DCGAN
5. Create Kaggle submission file

The CycleGAN and DCGAN parts divided into 4 parts:
1. Utils relevant to ALL the experiments
2. Experiment 1
3. Experiment 2
4. Experiment 3


## Installation - Must before training
Run the following:
1. Utils
2. Data Pre-proccessing


## Models Training:
If you want to try one of the models make sure to do the "installation" step before and then run the section of the model that you want to train.


### Test Environment
Run the test environment from the start to the end in order to check the models on inference.
